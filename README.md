# Hospital Optimization (Data Structure)
The project objective was to develop a priority system to help the health care system optimize the order in which their obstetrics and gynecology (Ob-Gyn) patients should receive care. Pregnant women carrying singletons or even multiples present a particularly vulnerable, high-risk population. The project would not only need to improve the efficiency of the system itself but more importantly, ensure timely clinical care to these patients based on their obstetric risk factors, vital signs, gestational age, and other progressive needs. During the challenge, we compared the runtime and efficiency to determine which of the three main methods for building the data structure of the priority system we should use (i.e. Standard Template Library, Linked Lists, and Heap.)
